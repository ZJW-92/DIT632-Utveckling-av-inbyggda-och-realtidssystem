1. How many threads (in total) are created during the execution of the program?

Two threads are created during the execution of the program, the first one is main, the second on is is created through pthread. 

2. What are lines 16, 17, 20, 25 and 26 intended for?

Line 16 - Declare a variable called tid of type pthread_t, which is intended
for the use of pthread_create to create a new thread and tid will be the name 
or id of the thread.
Line 17 - Declare a variable called attr  of type pthread_attr_t, which is intended
for the use of pthread_create to create a new thread and attr will be the 
attributes in the thread.
Line 20 - pthread_attr_init(&attr) allows initializing a thread attribute object. 
Line 25 - Create a new thread, with attributes specified by attr. And the thread is 
created executing runner with NULL as its argument.
Line 26 - Suspend execution of the calling thread did until the thread tid terminates, 
unless the thread tid has already terminated.


3. How many parameters are passed to function runner?

There is only one parameter NULL that is passed to the function runner through the last argument in pthread_create(&tid, &attr, runner, NULL).

4. How can function runner know the values for parameters that, such as max value, not are
passed to it?

max_value is declared globally and in the main it is assigned a value according to the input  and then the thread is created so the values can be passed to function runner.

5. Test how the behavior of the program changes if line 26 is omitted. Explain why.

If line 26 is omitted the array won't be completely sorted. 
Because the 'main' thread does not wait for the 'tid' thread to finish.
